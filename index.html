SpectraBot uses the following third-party services, which may store or process the data mentioned above:

    Google Firebase: Used for persistent storage of configuration and user data. Their <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy"> Privacy Policy</a> governs their practices.

D. Your Rights & Data Deletion

You have the right to request access to and deletion of any personally identifiable data the bot holds on you.

    Server Data: Server administrators can remove all stored Guild Data by simply removing the bot from the Discord server.
